#Astronomy Site Project

As an amateur astronomer, it is hard to find viewing locations or events in a new city or state without trawling through many astronomy club websites. My goal for this project is to create a webapp where people can submit viewing locations (whether they be club dark-sky sites, public observatories, or star parties) so they can be easily found by other astronomy enthusiasts. 

######MVP
Allow users to submit locations and minimal descriptions (to be viewed with a popup) and have the locations appear on a map. The plan is to use leaflet.js and CloudMade.

######Additional Features

* Be able to see detailed information on each site
* Be able to comment/review a site
* Filter map by public or private program, observatory, event, dates open, etc.
* Have a light pollution heatmap overlay. Contingent on finding light pollution data
